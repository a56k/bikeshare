### Summary Analysis

The analysis provides different routes we can take to strengthen the proposal for a bike-sharing business in Iowa. Because the industry tends to be seasonal due to the weather in Iowa, spring and summertime are the best time to engage in the business. Additionally, due to the proximity of highly recognizable locations in Iowa, the site for most of these bikes should be accessible by the subscribers or customers enlisting into the summer venture. 

Also, it helps to consider peak and maintenance hours. As shown in the analysis when looking at the Data from NYC – the bikes need constant maintenance in idle hours (i.e., past 10 PM and before 5 AM )– therefore, understanding what those hours look like will help the schedule and management of bike rental across town. in fact,  it ensures to serve every cluster of customers accordingly.
